I like software that sparks joy.

## Projects

- as a scientific software engineer, I'm currently helping [Proxima Fusion](https://www.proximafusion.com) in its mission to bring fusion power to the grid 
- most of my past work consisted in designing and implementing high-level, high-performance data processing interfaces for high-energy physics use cases in [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root)
- in my free time I'm working on [Kobold](https://gitlab.com/eguiraud/kobold-ssg), a static site generator written in Rust with a friendly CLI interface
- over the years I built a number of small Telegram bots to help with various tasks -- [lastdatestanding_bot](https://gitlab.com/eguiraud/lastdatestanding_bot) in particular turned out to be surprisingly useful
- as part of my PhD project I worked extensively on [TVO](https://github.com/tvlearn/tvo), a PyTorch package for unsupervised learning via truncated variational optimization

Here are [my dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/eguiraud/dotfiles) and [an Ansible playbook](https://gitlab.com/eguiraud/laptopsetup) to set up or re-create my environment starting from a base Arch Linux installation.
